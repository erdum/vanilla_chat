At the time of creating this project I only knew about basic web technologies

* Javascript
* Php
* MySql

## Demo
[Live Demo](http://erdum.42web.io/raw_chat) **Note:** Please don't abuse my innocent web-app

## Why I Created
At the end of 2020 I want to make a project which will showcase my skills,for that reason I created a simple but effective client side web application which will show all of the knowledge I have at that time.

## What I Learned
* How to manipulate DOM with javascript
* How dynamic content is generated on client side
* How use polling to update data in realtime
* Difficulties in creating realtime web-app with Php

## Bugs and Missing Features
* [ ] I am using a non practical way of displaying both parties their online status and it is not working

## Future
Because this web-app is not for practical use due to its horrible design I created its second version which is available on branch v2.0 of this repo
